# Sessions & events concepts

## About the sessions

Each tracking starts with a session. A session is considered to be a usage by anyone on a product. Each session is associated with a product, a version, and a date.

## About the events

Next, the tracking goes with the events. An event can be anything (a view, a click, etc.) and is registered to record the actions of the user within the session. Each event are related to a session, not a user.
